			<p>I'm a Research Associate in Dario Farina's Neuromechanics and Rehabilitation Technology group. I'm from Hungary, but I've been living in London since 2016. My research interest is understanding human movement and build devices that support it.</p>
			<p>I'd like to record what I've been up to on this site. If you'd prefer a summary, here's <a href="texts/Balint_Hodossy_CV_2025.pdf"> my CV</a>.</p>

            <h3>PhD Thesis</h3>
            <p>Written after my 4 year PhD at Imperial, titled <b>"Learning Steps: Models of Intent-Driven Lower Limb Prosthesis Use"</b>. It essentially compiles the 4 manuscripts I wrote into one document, aiming to merge EMG-based intent estimation models with RL-trained locomotion models. <br/>(It is shared under CC BY-NC 4.0.)</p>

          <h4>Shared Autonomy Locomotion Synthesis With a Virtual Powered Prosthetic Ankle</h4>
          <p>The core part of my project! I used RL to learn a gait policy for a humanoid agent to follow arbitrary walking paths. Then I introduced a second agent that controlled one of the ankles - representing an intent driven prosthes.</p>

          <h4>Leveraging High-Density EMG to Investigate Bipolar Electrode Placement for Gait Prediction Models</h4>
          <p>A much needed address of the location specificity of the muscle signal decoding methods I take in my EMG work. I was surprised that simply sampling electrode locations randomly during training ended up working so well!</p>

          <p>Translating my EMG models to high-level intent - so turns, stops, pivots instead of just straight walking. This abstract intent can be synthesized in simulation, which would mean not needing to simulate EMG for Sim2Real.</p>

I extended my locomotion agents to obstacles and slopes, and evaluated the advantage of the compliant foot. Manuscript under review.</p>

            <h3>Master's Thesis</h3>
            <p>This was my first long-term project with biosignal processing, motion capture and machine learning, titled <b>"Temporal Convolutional Network Based Trunk Muscle Signal
 Decoding for Exoskeleton Control"</b>. For significant portion of it I discuss how to mitigate ECG corruption in trunk EMG - a serious issue of traditional EMG control. Turns out TCNs simply learn to filter it out on their own!<br/>(It is shared under CC BY-NC 4.0.)</p>

          <h4>Simulating Wearable Robotics Workshop</h4>
          <p>This repo was the yearly evolving content for the workshop I hosted at the Summer School of Neurorehabilitation 2023-25. Now I use it to introduce RL and physics simulation methods to someone. Usually I don't end up using all the content that gathered up all the years - there's examples for simulating a robotic hand, finding a controller for a powered ankle exoskeleton, implementing LQR controllers for balancing and much more!</p>

          <h4>MyoChallenge 24/25</h4>
          <p>I was part of the organizing team of the MyoChallenge in 2024 and 2025. These were programming competitions at NeurIPS, tasking participants with controlling complex musculoskeletal models to achieve various tasks. Each year I contributed to designing and developing one of the challenges. In 2024 I helped with the bimanual manipulation task, and in 2025 I helped with the tabletennis task.</p>

          <h4>Student Led Conference</h4>
          <p>During our first year of PhD students in my programme, we decided to organize a conference! Covid had different plans. We improvised, and managed to pivot to an online event. Served as great distraction during lockdown.</p>

          <p>Each year I try to host 1-2 stories as a game master for my friends, using adventure plotlines I've written over the years. I'm working on releasing a module along with handouts such maps, newspapers, posters and puzzles I've made!</p>
